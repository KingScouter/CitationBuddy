# CitationBuddy

CitationBuddy is your best friend to keep the memories of your friends weirdest phrases and statements. Your friend celebrates a win with a weird flex? Quote them for eternity! You try to tell a story, but akwardly mess up the punch-line? Quote it and be reminded of your mistake day by day! You play online and some weird dude tries to be tough in chat, but makes himself a complete fool in the end? Add that moment and remember that fond memory time and time again with your buddies.

Whatever weird stuff you and your friends say and experience, everything is worth remembering if you got a laugh out of it.
