# CitationBuddy

CitationBuddy is your best friend to keep the memories of your friends weirdest phrases and statements. Your friend celebrates a win with a weird flex? Quote them for eternity! You try to tell a story, but akwardly mess up the punch-line? Quote it and be reminded of your mistake day by day! You play online and some weird dude tries to be tough in chat, but makes himself a complete fool in the end? Add that moment and remember that fond memory time and time again with your buddies.

Whatever weird stuff you and your friends say and experience, everything is worth remembering if you got a laugh out of it.

## Generated with Nx

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Start the application

Run `npx nx serve citation-buddy` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build citation-buddy` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
